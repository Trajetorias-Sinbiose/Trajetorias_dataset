# The Trajetorias dataset: an harmonized dataset of environmental, epidemiological, and economic indicators for the Brazilian Amazonian 

the Trajetorias dataset can be used to address questions related to the association between the agrarian systems in place in each municipality in 2006 and 2017, how they changed, and how they affected/were affected by environmental and epidemiological changes. It contains a rich set of indicators that allow analyzing the spatial and temporal relationship between economic trajectories, availability of natural resources and disease transmission. There are indicators of leishmaniasis, malaria, Chagas disease, and dengue, which are neglected tropical diseases prevalent in the Amazon region. These infectious diseases are indicative of social and environmental vulnerability, which include poverty, lack of basic sanitation, and reduced availability of drinking water. The dataset also includes a collection of environmental landscape metrics, calculated from satellite images, with the aim of characterizing Amazonian municipalities in terms of biodiversity loss, land use and cover patterns, transport network density and climate anomalies. For the economic indicators, we computed multidimensional poverty indices for rural and urban populations.  With this dataset, it is possible to investigate in a more integrated and consistent way the scenarios that impact the ecosystem and human health in the Amazon.
